# React image rotator one

We have an image of star, what we need to implement is 
on each click on star, the image rotates by <em>5deg</em>.

So initally,
Image has transform:rotate(0deg)
After first click
Image has transform:rotate(5deg)
After second click
Image has transform:rotate(10deg)

and so on like that
